\usage{
ReplyKeyboardRemove(remove_keyboard = TRUE, selective = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{remove_keyboard}{Requests clients to remove the custom keyboard.
(user will not be able to summon this keyboard; if you want to hide
the keyboard from sight but keep it accessible, use
\code{one_time_keyboard} in \code{\link{ReplyKeyboardMarkup}}).
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{selective}{Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard
to specific users only.}
}
\description{
Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will
remove the current custom keyboard and display the default
letter-keyboard. By default, custom keyboards are displayed until
a new keyboard is sent by a bot. An exception is made for one-time
keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a
button (see \code{\link{ReplyKeyboardMarkup}}).
